      <description>Dataset that has been used here is Seer Breast Cancer Data.

The dataset involved female patients with infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma breast cancer diagnosed in 2006-2010.

      <description>Aspiring data scientist with a biomedical engineering degree and many years of software development experience. Recently I was involved in building a software service company for restaurants with a small team. This experience helped me in many ways, especially expanding my vision of problem solving and how to think out of the box. Also I was involved in designing the data models to improve the data collection processes and make sure we have all the necessary features for data analysis.</description>
